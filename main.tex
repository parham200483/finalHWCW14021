\section{Git and Github}
\subsection{ Repository Initialization and Commits}
first of all in github we build a repository in our github account. then we make a folder named .github and in this folder we build another folder named workflows, in this new folder we make a file named main.yml and then we copy main.yml in help repository that made to help, then paste it in our main.yml and push it to our repository. This workflow helps to compile the latex file that we put in our repository. This workflow compile it tag by tag, so we have push every commits by tags and latex file must be pushed section by section.This latex file must include  sections for each category of the questions.
