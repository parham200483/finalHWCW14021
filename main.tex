\section{Git and Github}
\subsection{ Repository Initialization and Commits}
first of all in github we build a repository in our github account. Then we build a workflow that contanis main.yml. This workflow compiles the latex file that we put in our repository. This workflow compile it tag by tag, so we have to push every commits by tags and latex file must be pushed section by section.This latex file must include sections for each category of the questions.
\subsection{ GitHub Actions for LaTeX Compilation}
At the beggining I thought I have to make a folder named .github and then make a folder named workflow in .github and then make main.yml file in workflow folder and then push it in repository, but i ran it and it didnt work, so I delete it and in Actios in repository I made a workflow that contains main.yml and I copied main.yml in held repository into my workflow and then it worked.
